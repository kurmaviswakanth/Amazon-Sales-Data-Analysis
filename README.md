# Amazon Sales Data Analysis

## Overview
This project utilizes Power BI to analyze Amazon sales data, providing insights into key performance indicators (KPIs), customer behavior, and product trends. The goal of this analysis is to assist in making data-driven decisions for improving sales strategies and operational efficiency.

## Purpose
The primary purpose of this project is to:
- Analyze and visualize Amazon's sales data.
- Identify top-selling products and underperforming categories.
- Understand customer demographics and purchasing behavior.
- Analyze sales trends over time, including seasonal and promotional effects.
- Provide actionable insights for decision-making and strategy formulation.

## Visualizations
The Power BI file contains the following interactive visualizations:
- **Sales Summary Dashboard**: Displays KPIs such as total sales, average order value, and number of orders.
- **Customer Segmentation Dashboard**: Provides insights into customer demographics, purchase behavior, and regional distribution.
- **Product Performance Dashboard**: Compares product-level sales, highlights best and worst-performing items.
- **Geographic Sales Dashboard**: A map showcasing sales performance by different regions.
- **Time Series Analysis Dashboard**: Visualizes trends in sales data over time, highlighting peaks and seasonal patterns.

## Data Sources
The data used in this analysis includes:
- **Sales Data**: Transactional data with details of each order.
- **Customer Information**: Demographic and regional data on customers.
- **Product Catalog**: Data on products, including categories and pricing.
- **Order Details**: Comprehensive order-level information.

## Key Insights
From the analysis, several insights were derived:
- **Top Products**: Certain products consistently contribute to a large percentage of sales.
- **Customer Behavior**: A significant portion of the customer base is located in urban regions, with younger customers making more frequent purchases.
- **Sales Peaks**: There are noticeable sales spikes during holidays and major promotional periods.
- **Profit Margins**: Although some categories have high sales volumes, their profit margins vary, requiring further attention.
